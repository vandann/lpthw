#rules for if-statments
# 1. must have an else, even if it should never run put it in there with an error code
# IT WILL FIND MANY ERRORS
# 2. never nest if-statments more than 2 deep and always try for 1 deep
# 3. treat if-statments like paragraphs, add blank lines before and after
# 4. your Boolean tests should be SIMPLE. if they are complex move their calcs
# to variables earlier in your functino and use a good name for the variable

#rules for while-loop
# 1. use a while-loop only to loop forever! (only applies to python)
# 2. use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping

#debugging tips
# 1. do not use a debugger, its like a full-body scan on a sick person.. won't get
# specific useful info and you'll fine a whole lot of info that doesn't help
# 2. best way to debug is to use PRINT (on values, variables functions etc)
# 3. make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them.
# Don't write massive files of code before you try to run them!
# Code a little, runa a little, fix a little.
